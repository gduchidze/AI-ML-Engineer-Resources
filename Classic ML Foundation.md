# 1. Fundamentals of Machine Learning

Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Regression, Classification, Clustering

Overfitting, Underfitting, and Regularization

Bias-Variance Tradeoff


# 2. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values and outliers)

Feature Scaling (Normalization, Standardization)

Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction

Encoding Categorical Variables


# 3. Algorithms and Model Training

Linear Models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression)

Tree-Based Models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Neural Networks (ANN, CNN, RNN)

Optimization Techniques


# 4. Model Evaluation and Tuning

Cross-Validation (K-Fold, Leave-One-Out)

Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC- ROC)

Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearch, RandomSearch, etc.)

Handling Imbalanced Datasets


# 5. Machine Learning in Production - The Most important one!

Model Deployment (StreamLit, Azure ML, AWS SageMaker)

Monitoring and Maintaining Models

Pipelines for MLOps

Interpretability and Explainability (SHAP, LIME, Feature Importance)
